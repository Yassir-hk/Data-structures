# Data Structures Implementation in C++

This repository contains a collection of common data structures implemented in C++. These data structures are essential building blocks in computer science and are often used in various algorithms and applications.

## Included Data Structures

1. **Array**: A sequential collection of elements of the same type.
2. **Singly Linked List**: A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.
3. **Doubly Linked List**: Similar to a singly linked list, but each element also points to the previous one in the sequence.
4. **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last element points back to the first one, forming a circle.
5. **Queue (Array-based)**: A linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, implemented using an array.
6. **Stack (Array-based)**: A linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, implemented using an array.
7. **Queue (Linked List-based)**: Similar to the array-based queue, but implemented using a linked list.
8. **Stack (Linked List-based)**: Similar to the array-based stack, but implemented using a linked list.
9. **Binary Search Tree**: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
10. **Hash Table**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of slots, from which the desired value can be found, and it handle collisions using linked list.

## How to Use

Each data structure is implemented in its own C++ file and header file. To use a particular data structure in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the data structure you want to use.
3. Include the header file in your C++ project.
4. Instantiate the data structure and use its methods/functions as needed in your code.

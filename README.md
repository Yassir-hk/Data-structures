# Data structures
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing data in computer programs. They provide efficient and optimized ways to access, manipulate, and store data.
Data structures improve the efficiency of the program and code readability.

This repository contains my implementation of classic and common data structures using C++.

List of implemented data structures in this repository :
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Array based stack
- Linked list based stack
